However, if you wish to run these notebooks on your local machine, you can do the following:

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
   ```sh
   git clone xxxxxxxxxxx
   ```
   
2. Install the conda environment by typing the following in your terminal:
   ```sh
   conda env create -f tsa.yaml
   ```
   
3. Open the course in JupyterLab by typing the following in your terminal:
   ```sh
   conda activate tsa
   jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-plotly
   jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager plotlywidget
   jupyter lab
   ```
